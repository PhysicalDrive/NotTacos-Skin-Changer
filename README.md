# NotTacos Skin Changer
## What is this?
- This is a universal skin changer for og fortnite projects that uses [UESDK](https://github.com/NotTacs/UE-SDK) so that it can use the function "ServerChoosePart" on any version, which changes characters part to any cosmetic that you want.
- WARNING: DO NOT EVER INJECT THIS IN LATEST FORTNITE, YOU WILL GET INSTANT PERM-BANNED. This is meant for og fortnite only. I will not be responsible if you get your account banned on Fortnite or any ogfn projects.
